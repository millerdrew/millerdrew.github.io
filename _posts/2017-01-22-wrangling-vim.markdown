If you are looking for code editors that are beginner friendly, I would suggest [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).  Both are excellent, modern editing tools that any web developer should be comfortable with.

But if you're like me, and want to get a little crazy with an editor that has a steep learning curve but pays dividends down the road, it's hard to find something to match [Vim](http://www.vim.org/).  Do yourself a favor though and don't start with vanilla Vim... Instead get a nice starter pack such as this one created by Square called [Maximum Awesome](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/fly-vim-first-class-610f1a39b572#.qexo773dp).

It doesn't look like much until you realize it gives you complete control without ever having to resort to a mouse.  That's right:  With magical combinations of keystrokes you are able to zip around your files making changes at a much faster rate than you would otherwise.  The flipside is that you spend a lot of time in the beginning stumbling through those commands as you learn them.

Now I don't recommend jumping into Vim while cutting off all help... Make life a little easier on yourself by using MacVim.  It allows you to use the mouse when you need to and makes for a much smoother transition into the world of Vim.

Normal Vim is started on the command line like this:
```
vi
```
While for MacVim
```
mvim
```

An example of some shortcuts:

* Jumping around files with ,t (similar to cmd-p in sublime)
* Accessing directory through Nerdtree with ,d or ,f
* Creating/deleting/renaming files within Nerdtree with m
* Searching within a file with /
* Moving around with hjkl

There's many many more, and I plan on including a reference of the ones I use the most.

Here are some settings that I changed with my home directory in the .vimrc.local file:

```
colorscheme elflord
set lines=100 columns=200
set guifont=Menlo\ Regular:h24
```

Before I changed those settings I found the MacVim started in a tiny window with a tiny font... And the colorscheme is just for fun :smile:.  Another cool color scheme you might like to try is solorized.  

Give it a shot.  You might find Vim not so crazy after all :wink:.
